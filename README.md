# RSS Aggregator

This is a simple RSS aggregator developed just to experiment with ReactJS and Redux.
Also using components from Material UI.

## Getting started

First, set up the project:

`npm install`

Once you got it installed, you just have to start the app:

They are present since you can only add local channels from your development server.
